### ...This project was stopped due to Valorant's own API. 
Being merely a hobby, a Discord bot was too limited in terms of features in order to actually get
an application accepted for a personal API key. Riot Games' Valorant API also appears to be
in an underdeveloped state, with multiple endpoints returning 404 for odd reasons. Additionally, the added hassle 
of redirecting users who want to view their in-game stats to an implementation of Riot's own sign-on
authentication system was too much extra baggage for a seemingly simple project.
